This file contains models , data and jupiter notebooks for a ML project . 
the dataset  i used is heart disease ucl (cleveland dataset) .
This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine
learning. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality
reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, and deployment. Classification models like
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM will be used, alongside
K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning.
